# CYK-algorithm
In the Automata theory and formal languages course, we have an algorithm that checks whether a string belongs to the grammar or not.<br>

## Input form
In the first line, enter the chosen string that we call 'w'.<br>
In the next line, enter the natural number as known as 'n' that is explains to us the numbers of grammar production rules.<br>
After all, in the next n line(s), enter one of the grammar production rules.<br>
The correct way to input:

</div>

## Output form
If the string belongs to the grammar, print "Yes", otherwise "NO".

## Rules
<ul>
  <li>We use '-' instead of epsilon</li>
  <li>It is guaranteed that the input grammar form is normal Chomsky</li>
  <li>It is guaranteed that 'S' is the initial symbol</li>
</ul>
